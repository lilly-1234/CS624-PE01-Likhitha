# Hello World

## Input

The user input is static input, it is hardcoded directly into the app using three `Text` components. These inputs are:
- The full name of the student: **Likhitha Lakshmi Gudivada**
- The degree program: **MSCS**
- The school name: **City University of Seattle**

## Process

The app is built using React Native with Expo and contains only one `View` and three `Text` components, all styled using a `StyleSheet` object. The main `View` component acts as a container with a yellow background. The layout uses flex to center the text both vertically and horizontally. Each `Text` component displays name, degree, school.

## Output

The output is a mobile screen with a yellow background displaying three lines of text:
1. Likhitha Lakshmi Gudivada
2. MSCS
3. City University of Seattle
